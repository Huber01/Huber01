### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Agustin Juan Rubi, and have just finished Soy Henry, a five month Fullstack Development Bootcamp. 

I've had the chance to learn and build projects with these techs

To get to this stage, I've had to change my life 180 degrees. I used to be a Navy Officer, sailing and diving at sea. Now IÂ´m in my computer, sailing and diving in code, trying to find solutions!
I must say I trully found a new world, and discovered a new passion. 

What really gets me, is the fact that anything is possible when you start coding. You just have to analyze the problem, study, and start coding!

In my time in the navy I've learnt that the best way to work is teamwork. Two minds set together are always better than one. 
The trick is syncing them up. That's where the experience comes in. IÂ´ve lead many teams in different situations and performing various activities (sailing through ice, sea to land replenishment, ship salvage and diving, peacekeeping operations, amongst others) and found out I really like building teams. My key to success is very good communication, let my teammates know whats going on, and I expect the same back. And of course, ALWAYS remain CALM. 

Now, I want to learn how to work effectively in a Development team. I have to keep on learning, see how its done from the scratch, and am ready to put on the weight and get going. I am open to work and look forward to work 100% remote.

If you are interested please contact me. My personal information is in my profile, but I'll put it in here as well, so you don't have to keep on looking!
